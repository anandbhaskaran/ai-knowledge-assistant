# Climate Change Impact and Mitigation Strategies

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with far-reaching impacts on ecosystems, economies, and human well-being. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded with high confidence that human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century.

## Current Impacts

### Rising Temperatures
Global surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.1°C since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900). The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record.

### Sea Level Rise
Global mean sea level has risen by about 20 cm since 1900, with the rate of rise accelerating in recent decades. The IPCC projects a rise of 0.3 to 1.0 meters by 2100, depending on emission scenarios.

### Extreme Weather Events
Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events including:
- Heat waves
- Drought
- Intense rainfall and flooding
- Hurricanes and typhoons

### Biodiversity Loss
According to the World Wildlife Fund, climate change could cause up to 30% of species to be at increased risk of extinction if warming exceeds 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

## Mitigation Strategies

### Renewable Energy Transition
Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that renewable energy and energy efficiency measures could achieve 90% of the carbon reductions needed by 2050.

### Energy Efficiency
Improving energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industry can reduce energy consumption and associated emissions. The IEA suggests that energy efficiency improvements could deliver more than 40% of the emissions reductions needed by 2040.

### Carbon Pricing
Placing a price on carbon emissions through carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems creates economic incentives to reduce emissions. Over 60 carbon pricing initiatives have been implemented or scheduled worldwide.

### Nature-Based Solutions
Protecting and restoring forests, wetlands, and other ecosystems can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while providing additional benefits for biodiversity and human well-being. The Nature Conservancy estimates that natural climate solutions can provide up to 37% of the emission reductions needed by 2030.

## International Cooperation

The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C, preferably to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. As of 2023, 196 parties have signed the agreement, committing to increasingly ambitious climate action through nationally determined contributions (NDCs).
